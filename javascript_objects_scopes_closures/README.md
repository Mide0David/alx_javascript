# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes, and Closures

## Project Overview

This project is part of the JavaScript curriculum and aims to help you understand and practice the fundamentals of JavaScript programming, including objects, scopes, closures, and more. By completing this project, you will gain a deeper understanding of the key concepts that underpin JavaScript development.

**Project Level:** Amateur

**Project Owner:** Guillaume, CTO at Holberton School

**Project Weight:** 1

**Note:** Your score will be updated once you launch the project review.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the need for external references:

### General
- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to create an object in JavaScript
- What 'this' means
- What 'undefined' means
- Why variable type and scope are important
- What is a closure
- What is a prototype
- How to inherit an object from another

## Requirements

### General
- Recommended editors: Visual Studio Code
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x)
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should be semistandard compliant (Rules of Standard + semicolons on top), and as reference, adhere to the AirBnB style
- The length of your files will be tested using 'wc'
- You are not allowed to use 'var'

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of JavaScript programming. Below is a summary of the tasks:

1. **Rectangle #0**
   - Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle using the class notation.

2. **Rectangle #1**
   - Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle using the class notation.
   - The constructor must take 2 arguments 'w' and 'h'.
   - Initialize the instance attribute 'width' with the value of 'w'.
   - Initialize the instance attribute 'height' with the value of 'h'.

3. **Rectangle #2**
   - Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle using the class notation.
   - The constructor must take 2 arguments 'w' and 'h'.
   - Initialize the instance attribute 'width' with the value of 'w'.
   - Initialize the instance attribute 'height' with the value of 'h'.
   - If 'w' or 'h' is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.

4. **Rectangle #3**
   - Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle using the class notation.
   - The constructor must take 2 arguments 'w' and 'h'.
   - Initialize the instance attribute 'width' with the value of 'w'.
   - Initialize the instance attribute 'height' with the value of 'h'.
   - If 'w' or 'h' is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
   - Create an instance method called 'print()' that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'.

5. **Rectangle #4**
   - Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle using the class notation.
   - The constructor must take 2 arguments 'w' and 'h'.
   - Initialize the instance attribute 'width' with the value of 'w'.
   - Initialize the instance attribute 'height' with the value of 'h'.
   - If 'w' or 'h' is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
   - Create an instance method called 'print()' that prints the rectangle using the character 'X'.
   - Create an instance method called 'rotate()' that exchanges the width and the height of the rectangle.
   - Create an instance method called 'double()' that multiplies the width and the height of the rectangle by 2.

6. **Square #0**
   - Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle.
   - You must use the class notation for defining your class and extend Rectangle.
   - The constructor must take 1 argument 'size'.
   - The constructor of Rectangle must be called (by using super()).

7. **Square #1**
   - Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Square of 5-square.js.
   - You must use the class notation for defining your class and extend Square.
   - Create an instance method called 'charPrint(c)' that prints the rectangle using the character 'c'.
   - If 'c' is undefined, use the character 'X'.

### Score

Your score for each task will be determined based on its completion.
