# JavaScript Warm Up

![Project Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-JavaScript%20Warm%20Up-brightgreen)

This project is part of the ALX School curriculum, aimed at providing novice developers with a warm-up experience in JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts and practices of JavaScript, enabling learners to get started with scripting and understand its importance in web front-end development.

## Background Context

JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for various purposes, including scripting and building interactive web front-ends. In this project, you will dive into JavaScript's basics to grasp essential concepts.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

### General
- Understand the significance of JavaScript programming.
- Execute a JavaScript script.
- Create variables and constants.
- Differentiate between `var`, `const`, and `let`.
- Identify all available data types in JavaScript.
- Utilize `if` and `if ... else` statements.
- Comment JavaScript code.
- Assign values to variables.
- Employ `while` and `for` loops.
- Utilize `break` and `continue` statements.
- Define and utilize functions.
- Describe the behavior of functions without a return statement.
- Understand variable scope.
- Work with arithmetic operators.
- Manipulate dictionaries.
- Import files.

## Requirements

### General
- Recommended code editor: Visual Studio Code.
- All code will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
- Ensure all code files end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Your code should follow the semistandard style (version 14.x.x) with semicolons. Reference: AirBnB style.
- File length will be tested using `wc`.

## Installation

To set up the required environment, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js version 14.x:
   ```
   $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
   $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   ```

2. Install the semistandard code style globally:
   ```
   $ sudo npm install semistandard --global
   ```

## Tasks

### Task 0: First Constant, First Print

- Write a script that prints "JavaScript is amazing."
- Create a constant variable called `myVar` with the value "JavaScript is amazing."
- Use `console.log(...)` to print the output.
- Do not use `var`.

### Task 1: 3 Languages

- Write a script that prints three lines:
  - The first line: "C is fun."
  - The second line: "Python is cool."
  - The third line: "JavaScript is amazing."
- Use `console.log(...)` for all output.
- Do not use `var`.

### Task 2: Loop to Languages

- Write a script that prints three lines (similar to Task 1) using an array of strings and a loop.
- The first line: "C is fun."
- The second line: "Python is cool."
- The third line: "JavaScript is amazing."
- Use `console.log(...)` for all output.
- Do not use `var`.
- Do not use any if/else statement.
- Use only one `console.log`.
- Utilize a loop (while, for, etc.).

### Task 3: Object

- Update the script to replace the value 12 with 89 in the `myObject` variable.
- Do not use `var`.

### Task 4: Add File

- Write a function that returns the addition of two integers.
- The function must be visible from outside.
- The function should be named `add`.
- Do not use `var`.

### Task 5: Const or Not Const (Advanced)

- Write a file that modifies the value of `myVar` to 333.
- This exercise doesn't pass the semistandard style, so don't worry about it.

### Task 6: Call Me Moby (Advanced)

- Write a function that executes a given function `x` times.
- The function must be visible from outside.
- Prototype: `function (x, theFunction)`.
- Do not use `var`.

### Task 7: Add Me Maybe (Advanced)

- Write a function that increments and calls a function.
- The function must be visible from outside.
- Prototype: `function (number, theFunction)`.
- Do not use `var`.

### Task 8: Increment Object (Advanced)

- Update the script by adding a new function, `incr`, that increments the integer value in the `myObject` variable.
- Do not use `var`.
